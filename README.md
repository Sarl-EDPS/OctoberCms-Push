# OctoberCMS-Onesignal-Push

## This plugin isn't a OneSignal official plugin, but use their API.

### Getting starting with Push Notification

This plugin use OneSignal API for push notification.
OneSignal is a high volume and reliable push notification system for mobile and web applications. We support all major native and mobile platforms by providing dedicated SDKs for each platform, a RESTful server API, and an online dashboard to send push notifications.

### Why should I use OneSignal instead of sending messages directly through GCM (from Google).
- Implementing reliable interfaces to the GCM and APN protocols is difficult. 
- There are open source projects to do it, but even the best ones break when message quantity begins to exceed 500,000 at a time. - These protocols also change frequently, for instance, last week Apple released a new protocol and deprecated their old one.
- OneSignal provides marketing tools including A/B testing, segment targeting, localization, drip marketing, and conversion tracking.
- OneSignal provides a single UI and API to deliver messages across iOS, Android, Amazon Fire, Windows Phone, Chrome Apps, Safari, Chrome Web, Vivaldi, Opera, and Firefox.
